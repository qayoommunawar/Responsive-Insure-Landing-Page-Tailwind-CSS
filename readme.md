## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSs
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Almost 99% of CSS is Tailwind, aprat from CSS Resets.


```html
<button type="button" 
        class=" bg-transparent focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-offset-2 
        focus-visible:white 
        border border-white p-4 py-2 text-white">
          How we work
      </button>
```

### Continued development

My next target is to learn & practice proper Tailwind build from inliner, so that my CSS is less messy and 
Webiste is build ready.
